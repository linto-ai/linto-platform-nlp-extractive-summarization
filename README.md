# linto-platform-nlp-extractive-summarization

## Description
This repository is for building a Docker image for LinTO's NLP service: Extractive Summarization on the basis of [linto-platform-nlp-core](https://github.com/linto-ai/linto-platform-nlp-core), can be deployed along with [LinTO stack](https://github.com/linto-ai/linto-platform-stack) or in a standalone way (see Develop section in below).

LinTo's NLP services adopt the basic design concept of spaCy: [component and pipeline](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines), components (located under the folder `components/`) are decoupled from the service and can be easily re-used in other spaCy projects, components are organised into pipelines for realising specific NLP tasks. 

This service can be launched in two ways: REST API and Celery task, with and without GPU support.

## Usage

See documentation : [https://doc.linto.ai](https://doc.linto.ai)

## Deploy

With our proposed stack [https://github.com/linto-ai/linto-platform-stack](https://github.com/linto-ai/linto-platform-stack)

# Develop

## Build and run
1 Download models into `./assets` on the host machine (can be stored in other places), make sure that `git-lfs`: [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is installed and availble at `/usr/local/bin/git-lfs`.
```bash
cd linto-platform-nlp-extractive-summarization/
bash scripts/download_models.sh
```

2 configure running environment variables
```bash
cp .envdefault .env
```

| Environment Variable | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_LANG` | A space-separated list of supported languages for the application | fr en |
| `ASSETS_PATH_ON_HOST` | The path to the assets folder on the host machine | ./assets |
| `ASSETS_PATH_IN_CONTAINER` | The volume mount point of models in container | /app/assets |
| `LM_MAP` | A JSON string that maps each supported language to its corresponding language model | {"fr":"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2","en":"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"} |
| `SERVICE_MODE` | The mode in which the service is served, either "http" (REST API) or "task" (Celery task) | "http" |
| `CONCURRENCY` | The maximum number of requests that can be handled concurrently | 1 |
| `USE_GPU` | A flag indicating whether to use GPU for computation or not, either "True" or "False" | True |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | The name of the micro-service | extsumm |
| `SERVICES_BROKER` | The URL of the broker server used for communication between micro-services | "redis://localhost:6379" |
| `BROKER_PASS` | The password for accessing the broker server | None |

4 Build image
```bash
sudo docker build --tag lintoai/linto-platform-nlp-extractive-summarization:latest .
```
or
```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```

5 Run container with GPU support, make sure that [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installing-on-ubuntu-and-debian) and GPU driver are installed.
```bash
sudo docker run --gpus all \
--rm -p 80:80 \
-v $PWD/assets:/app/assets:ro \
--env-file .env \
lintoai/linto-platform-nlp-extractive-summarization:latest
```
<details>
  <summary>Check running with CPU only setting</summary>
  
  - remove `--gpus all` from the first command.
  - set `USE_GPU=False` in the `.env`.
</details>

or

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```
<details>
  <summary>Check running with CPU only setting</summary>
  
  - remove `runtime: nvidia` from the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - set `USE_GPU=False` in the `.env`.
</details>


6 If running under `SERVICE_MODE=http`, navigate to `http://localhost/docs` or `http://localhost/redoc` in your browser, to explore the REST API interactively. See the examples for how to query the API.


## Specification for `http://localhost/extsumm/{lang}`

### Supported languages
| {lang} | Model | Size |

### Implementation details
This repository only intergrates the [Bert Extractive Summarizer](https://github.com/dmmiller612/bert-extractive-summarizer) with [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) embeddings, the usage of general Hugging Face transformers, Elbow calculation, and coreference techniques are not implemented.


## Testing Celery mode locally
1 Install Redis on your local machine, and run it with:
```bash
redis-server --protected-mode no --bind 0.0.0.0 --loglevel debug
```

2 Make sure in your `.env`, these two variables are set correctly as `SERVICE_MODE=task` and `SERVICES_BROKER=redis://172.17.0.1:6379`

Then start your docker container with either `docker run` or `docker-compose up` as shown in the previous section.

3 On your local computer, run this python script: 
```python
from celery import Celery
celery = Celery(broker='redis://localhost:6379/0', backend='redis://localhost:6379/1')
r = celery.send_task(
    'extsumm_task', 
    (
